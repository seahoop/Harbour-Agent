# Harbour-Agent

## Description
### Harbour-Agent is an AI-powered real estate investment assistant that helps small-scale investors, landlords, and homeowners evaluate properties instantly without the cost and delay of traditional feasibility studies. With just an address, Harbour-Agent automatically gathers and analyzes public data sources—including parcel and tax records, zoning and land use codes, rental benchmarks from HUD and Census APIs, flood and environmental risk data, and neighborhood indicators such as schools, crime, and demographics. It then compiles this information into a professional-grade feasibility and investment report, showing what can be legally developed on the property (e.g., single-family home, ADU/DADU, duplex, or mixed-use), the maximum buildable area, and whether zoning or setbacks limit potential. The report also delivers financial forecasts—including estimated rental income, resale value, and cash flow projections—paired with neighborhood and market insights to measure demand and livability. To make the analysis more intuitive, Harbour-Agent can generate AI-powered visualizations that illustrate possible development scenarios, allowing investors to literally “see” the future potential of their property. By automating a process that traditionally costs thousands of dollars and takes weeks of consultant time, Harbour-Agent delivers fast, affordable, and enterprise-grade decision support in minutes, empowering everyday investors to act with confidence and speed.
