## Thoughts
- Investors often analyze tens-hundreds of properties in a given area, and quickly filtering out those that aren’t feasible can be extremely time-consuming. Many property listings also suffer from poor photos that fail to reflect the true value or condition of the home. As a result, investors browsing the public market may see long listing times and assume that other investors have already deemed the property unprofitable—causing them to pass on opportunities that could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is where Harbour Agent comes in. By simply entering an address, the agent uses advanced computer vision to analyze MLS photos and evaluate the property’s condition alongside official city data, helping investors uncover hidden value that others overlook.
